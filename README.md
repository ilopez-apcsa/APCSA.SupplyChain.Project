## Preface

You are the new Software Development intern for a local area food-bank/pantry. Your high school job board had a listing, they needed someone who could program in Java. The internship is 3 weeks long.

## Introduction
Welcome to the Pacific Northwest Food Bank (PNWFB). We are super glad you are here!

We provide a really valuable resource to the community, and our donors have really high expectations to make sure their monies are well used.

But we have a problem.  Our inventory management software cannot give us proper reports/tools to help us plan the needs we have for the area.

This is where we need your help.
